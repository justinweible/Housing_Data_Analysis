 2. Identify the key factors in predicting the price of a house
 3. Advise potential home owners in how to get most for their money.

## Analysis:
Location, the year that the house was built, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, grade, whether or not it is a waterfront property and whether or not it was renovated all proved to be key components to determining the price of the house.

### Proximity to Downtown 
Each mile out of the city reduces the price of the house by approximately $10,400.

The age of the house decreases the value by approximately $1,172 per year.

## Conclusions:
The closer the house a house is to downtown, the more expensive it'll be. Within the two categories of within 5 miles of downtown and more than 5 mile sfrom downtown, it is clear the affect that squarefootage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and year built have  on the price. (See images and analysis above.)
